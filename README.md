# :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: GitHub Faker

This repo pushes several commits to GitHub on a daily basis. It tries to 
simulate an active developer on GitHub.

We used to run this as a cron job on a t3.micro EC2 instance for two months.
Keep in mind that you need to modify the git user to avoid committing with ubuntu but with your real user instead.
